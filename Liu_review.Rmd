# Liu Review

This file is Huyu Liu's review of Hazinia's R assignment.

##Data import

Cannot import data with the code from `Data import` part, but the codes in `Data processing` is correct.

##Data processing

A lot of `%>%` are used, making the codes simple, so the filter and transposed part is great. And the replace part is done in a way that I did not know.

##Graphs

The density chart is very beautiful, but the x axis need to be adjusted a little bit with `theme(axis.text.x = element_text(vjust =  , hjust =  , angle =  ))` to deal with the overlap of the text.

##Data processing part 2

Still the x axis need to be adjusted.

The last figure is awesome!
